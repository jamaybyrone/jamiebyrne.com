              Photography has always been a huge part of how I connect with the
              world — finding beauty in light, shadow, and the quiet in-between
              moments. Over the years, it’s taken me on an incredible journey of
              creativity and connection. But for now, the camera is resting.

              I’m currently taking a break from photography as I focus my energy
              on restoring a 1950s bungalow — a personal project that’s as much
              about craftsmanship as it is about creativity. The process has
              been hands-on and transformative, giving me a fresh appreciation
              for space, detail, and design. From sanding floors to uncovering
              mid-century quirks, it’s been a rewarding detour from the
              viewfinder.

              That said, this is just a pause — not a full stop. Photography
              will be back in my life soon, and when it returns, it’ll come with
              new stories, new inspiration, and a new setting (with some
              seriously good lighting).

              While I’ve stepped away from photos, I’m very much still working —
              as a <strong>full stack developer</strong>. My background spans
              frontend and backend development, with experience building
              responsive, accessible, and high-performance applications across
              modern tech stacks. If you’re here looking for code, not cameras —
              you’re in luck. There’s a link to my CV in the navigation above
              where you can learn more about my work and experience.

              I also own a professional printer and have plans to make a curated
              selection of my prints available to purchase. I have a version of this website, in a branch which

              This season is one of renovation — both in brick and in spirit.

              stopping by. I look forward to sharing the next chapter with you.
